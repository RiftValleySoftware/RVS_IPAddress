Swift IP Address Handler
=

Introduction
-

This struct/protocol is a basic standalone [struct](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html) and [String](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) [extension](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Extensions.html) that makes handling [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) and [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) quite simple.

Its principal use is to take a string that was generated by something like a text entry, and establish a proper IP address from that string. It's a smart parser.

Start With A String
-

The struct can be instantiated by supplying a String, with a valid representation of either an IPv4 IP address, or an IPv6 IP address. The struct will parse the String, and will store an internal [Array](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array) of [Int](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int)s, representing that IP address. It will then be able to return the IP address in whatever format is required.

It validates the correctness of the address before storing it, so you know that the address is always in a valid form.

It does not verify that the address actually leads anywhere. It merely ensures that it is a correctly-formed IP address.

You can submit any string, and the factory method will ensure that an instance of the correct IP version handler is generated.

Example
-
    if let testIP = RVS_IPAddressExtractIPAddress("1.2.3.4") {
        print("This should be an IPv4 Address: \(String(describing: testIP))")
    }

    if let testIP = RVS_IPAddressExtractIPAddress("1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8") {
        print("This should be an IPv6 Address: \(String(describing: testIP))")
    }

You can also add TCP ports to the address:

    if let testIP = RVS_IPAddressExtractIPAddress("1.2.3.4:5") {
        print("This should be an IPv4 Address: \(String(describing: testIP))")
    }

    if let testIP = RVS_IPAddressExtractIPAddress("[1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8]:9") {
        print("This should be an IPv6 Address: \(String(describing: testIP))")
    }

The resulting addresses can be accessed as Arrays of Int, or as String, either with or without the TCP port.
